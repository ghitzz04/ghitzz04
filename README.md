# 👋 Hi, I'm Ghita AZZOUZI
**Aspiring Robotics and Autonomous Systems Engineering Student**

## 🚀 About Me
A 4th year student at **Polytech Nice Sophia**. I am deeply curious about how robotics bridges multiple worlds—blending software, electronics, and mechanics into a single intelligent system. I thrive on applying my knowledge to the creation of end-to-end autonomous solutions, driven by the challenge of turning complex theory into fully functional, cohesive robotic projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Languages & Frameworks
- **Robotics:** ROS 2, Arduino, Gazebo, FreeRTOS
- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, Keras, MediaPipe, OpenCV, LSTM

### Tools & Platforms
- **Embedded:** Nvidia Jetson Nano, STM32, Raspberry Pi, ESP32
- **DevOps:** Git, Docker, CMake, Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Design:** Fusion 360 (CAD), PrusaSlicer

## 📂 Highlighted Projects
- **Gesture-Controlled Robot Dog:** An end-to-end Computer Vision pipeline using MediaPipe and LSTM networks, containerized with Docker and deployed on an Nvidia Jetson Nano for real-time robotic control.
- **French Robotics Cup 2025:** Design and development of a fleet of three identical mobile robots, covering the full mechatronic stack: CAD modeling (Fusion 360), custom PCB design, and hardware integration.
- **C++ Pathfinding Engine:** A high-performance navigation tool implemented in Modern C++, featuring A*, Dijkstra, and BFS algorithms to compute shortest paths on real-world map data.

## 📈 Current Focus
I am currently seeking a 4-month Internship (Assistant Engineer level) starting April 2026
